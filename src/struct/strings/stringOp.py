find the longest palindrome in a string
Approach 1: O(n^2), check from each one as center, with hide padding
Approach 2: O(n), Manacher's ALGORITHM: first convert seq to odd len string with '#' padding

    Given a sequence seq, returns a list l such that l[2 * i + 1]
    holds the length of the longest palindrome centered at seq[i]
    (which must be odd), l[2 * i] holds the length of the longest
    palindrome centered between seq[i - 1] and seq[i] (which must be
    even), and l[2 * len(seq)] holds the length of the longest
    palindrome centered past the last element of seq (which must be 0,
    as is l[0]).

    The actual palindrome for l[i] is seq[s:(s + l[i])] where s is i
    // 2 - l[i] // 2. (// is integer division.)

    Example:
    naiveLongestPalindrome('ababa') -> [0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 1]
    
    Runs in quadratic time.
