Before coding, 
- Must make clear of the question, and list all constraints for the question,
- also with all special cases at the head.

- in method body, put algorithm steps in it as comment, and talk along to interviewer
- At last, coding as fast as I can.

=== number related questions ===

* integer or decimal - linear sort different
* negotive vs positive - linear sort different
* 0 or non-0 - computation different
* the range - representation, sort, computation exception
* calculation conversion and decimal cut issue

=== String or char related questions ===

* null or size 0 -- they different
* spaces, tab, return
* for C, last char maybe '\0', need to attend
* letter, number or symbols -- ASCII
* upperCase or lowerCase for letter
